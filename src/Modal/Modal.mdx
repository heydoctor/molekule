# Modal

Modals are a great way to add dialogs to your site for lightboxes, user notifications, or completely custom content.

## Example

Toggle a working modal demo by clicking the button below. It will slide up and fade in from the bottom of the page.

<Playground>
  <ModalExample />
</Playground>

## Handling Long Content

When modals become too long for the user’s viewport or device, they scroll independent of the page itself.

<Playground>
  <ModalExample body={<div>{new Array(50).fill(null).map(() => <p>I'm really long annoying content.</p>)}</div>}/ >
</Playground>
